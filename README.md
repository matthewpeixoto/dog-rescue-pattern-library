fonts:
  primary: |
    Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.
colours:
  primary: |
    The primary colours symbolize loyality and trust. Use these colours for navigation bars, headers, and other elements where branding makes sense.
  accent: |
    The accent colours symbolize love and care. Use these colours to indicate important buttons and interactive elements.
  neutral: |
    The neutral colours are the foundation for beautiful layouts and design that don't overbear the user. Use these colours for typography and backgrounds.
