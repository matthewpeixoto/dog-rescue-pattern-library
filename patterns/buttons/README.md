There are two standard types of buttons:

- **Important button.** Use important buttons to emphasize important action functions like the "Submit" button on an application. There should rarely be more than two important buttons on a single page. The small important button is for use in the sub navigation.
- **Subtle button.** The Subtle button is the most commonly used button style Use them to help guide users to learn or view more without obtruding their experience. The large subtle button should be used for banners.
