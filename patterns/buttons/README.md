There are two standard types of buttons:

- **Important button.** Use important buttons to emphasize important action functions like the "Submit" button on an application. There should rarely be more than two important buttons on a single page. Use the small important button for subnavigation bars.
- **Subtle button.** Subtle buttons are the most commonly used types. Use them to help guide users to learn or view more without obtruding their experience. Use the large subtle button for banners.
