main-nav: |
  The main navigation is used at the top of every page. It drives users to the various inside pages and is used to express the Loyal Rescue brand.
sub-nav: |
  The sub navigation is used to jump between pages that categorically fall under the same main section.
tab-nav: |
  The tab navigation is used to denote progress-based or tab-based actions. Use this navigation to break long application forms into manageable pieces.
breadcrumbs: |
  Breadcrumbs provide context to users as they browse and allow them to retrace their steps. Breadcrumbs are placed in the footer to avoid conflicting with the main and sub navigations.
filter: |
  The filter allows users to more specifically browse through Loyal Rescue's available dogs. Place the filter directly above the available dogs section.
search: |
  The search bar allows users to search the entire Loyal Rescue website and get to where they want to go faster. The search bar can be integrated into the main navigation or used on it's own.
