main-nav: |
  The main navigation is used at the top of every page. It drives users to the various inside pages of the website and helps express the Loyal Rescue brand.
sub-nav: |
  The sub navigation is used to jump between pages that categorically fall under the same main section.
tab-nav: |
  The tab navigation is used to denote progress-based or tab-based actions. Use this navigation to break long application forms into manageable pieces.
breadcrumbs: |
  Breadcrumbs provide context to users as they browse and allow them to retrace their steps. Breadcrumbs are placed in the footer so that they conflict with the main or sub navigations.
